    <div style="line-height:2;">I am a Computer Science major at ISU with a minor in Security and Risk. I have knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I am still currently
        building skills in these areas.<br> My focus is primarily cybersecurity and full-stack development. I plan on working
        to get security certifications and the IBM full stack course certification in the near future.<br> In my free time, I enjoy working on my 
        programming skills as well as playing video games for enjoyment to wind down after a while.
